            ü¶æ  I&apos;ve taken many online courses on programming and computer science topics like Javascript,Python, Algorithms and Data Structures, IOT, Blockchain, Networking, Shell Scripting, Security, and more. I gravitate to responsive UI coding and design with React and CSS, though I do much of my own graphic design and image editing (things I&apos;ve picked up along the way). This website and its contents were coded entirely by me with ReactJS, and CSS.
